# Notes :: Advent of Code 2017 :: Day 11 :: Hex Ed

This puzzle involves a hex map.  The key was to get an understanding of a
coordinate system that could be used with the hex map.  A [page][1] by
Red Blob Games was instrumental in my solving this puzzle.  I used the Cube
Coordinate System described in the page.  I did have to rotate the system
because of the orientation of the hexes in the Advent of Code puzzle versus
the orientation used in the article.
